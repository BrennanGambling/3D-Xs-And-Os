# 3D-Xs-And-Os
This is 3D X's and O's. Each 2D X's and O's board represent a layer of the 3D X's and O's cube with the left most being the top and the right most being the bottom. To best play the game think of the cube as 2D X's and O's from the top of the cube, the front of the cube, and the side of the cube.
